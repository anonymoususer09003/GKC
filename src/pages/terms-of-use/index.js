        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Provision, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Provision or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Provision or the requirement that any remaining claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Provision; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those claims, the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration

The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof, provided that any award may be challenged in a court of competent jurisdiction.

      <h4 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 pt-5">(e) Arbitration Fees and Awards. </h4>
      <p className="text-lg">
        The payment of filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the relevant AAA Rules subject to the following modifications:
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        i.	If you initiate arbitration under this Arbitration Provision after participating in the optional negotiation process described in section (j) below and are otherwise required to pay a filing fee under the relevant AAA Rules, The Corporate Group agrees that, unless your claim is for $5,000 or more, your share of the filing and arbitration fees is limited to $50, and that, after you submit proof of payment of the filing fee to The Corporate Group, The Corporate Group will promptly reimburse you for all but $50 of the filing fee. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such filing and arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        ii.	If The Corporate Group initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Provision, The Corporate Group will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        iii.	Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any state equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        iv.	At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable arbitration fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        v.	Although under some laws The Corporate Group may have a right to an award of attorneys fees and non-filing fee expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, The Corporate Group agrees that it will not seek such an award.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        vi.	If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of The Corporate Group’s last written settlement offer made after you participated in good faith in the optional Negotiation process described in section (i) below, then The Corporate Group will pay you the amount of the award or U.S. $1,000, whichever is greater.
      </p>      
      
      <h4 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 pt-5">(f) Location and Manner of Arbitration. </h4>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Unless you and The Corporate Group agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings between you and The Corporate Group will take place in the county of your billing address. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, The Corporate Group agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as determined by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
      </p>      
      <h4 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 pt-5">(g) Exceptions to Arbitration. </h4>
      <p className="text-lg">
        This Arbitration Provision shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims: (1) small claims actions brought on an individual basis that are within the scope of such small claims court’s jurisdiction; (2) a representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorneys general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in section (c) of such action is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) claims for workers’ compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits; and (4) claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of law.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        Nothing in this Arbitration Provision prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with any federal, state, or local agency and nothing in this Arbitration Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any federal, state, or local agency, to the extent you are entitled to pursue such a claim, in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration; however, you knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to seek or recover money damages of any type pursuant to any administrative complaint and instead may seek such relief only through arbitration under this Arbitration Provision. Nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Provision prevents your participation in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim, or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision.
      </p>      
      <h4 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 pt-5">(h) Severability. </h4>
      <p className="text-lg">
        In addition to the severability provisions in section (c) above, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Provision shall be given full force and effect.
      </p>      
      <h4 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 pt-5">(i) Opting Out of Arbitration. </h4>
      <p className="text-lg">
        You may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate claims defined in section (e)(3) pursuant to the terms of this section. If you do not wish to be subject to this Arbitration Provision with respect to claims, you may opt out of arbitration with respect to such claims by notifying The Corporate Group in writing of your desire to opt out of arbitration for such claims, which writing must be dated, signed, and delivered by: (1) electronic mail to info@GeekKidsCode.com.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        In order to be effective, (A) the writing must clearly indicate your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Provision with respect to claims, (B) the writing must include the name, phone number, and email address associated with you, and (C) the email or envelope containing the signed writing must be sent within 30 days of the date this Agreement is executed by you. Should you not opt out within the 30-day period, you and The Corporate Group shall be bound by the terms of this Arbitration Provision in full.
      </p>      
      <p className="text-lg">
        You should assume that there may be now, and may be in the future, lawsuits against The Corporate Group alleging class, collective, and/or representative claims in which the plaintiffs seek to act on your behalf, and which, if successful, could result in some monetary recovery to you. But if you do agree to arbitration of claims with The Corporate Group under this Arbitration Provision, you are agreeing in advance that you will bring all such claims, and seek all monetary and other relief, against The Corporate Group in an individual arbitration provision. You are also agreeing in advance that you will not participate in, or seek to recover monetary or other relief, for such claims in any court action or class, collective, and/or representative action. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this Arbitration Provision and you will not be subject to retaliation, if you exercise your right to assert claims or timely opt-out of arbitration, for any claims under this Arbitration Provision.
      </p>      

      <h4 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 pt-5">(j) Optional Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Process. </h4>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and The Corporate Group may agree to first attempt to negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the parties informally for 30 days, unless this time period is mutually extended by you and The Corporate Group. A party who intends to seek negotiation under this section must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.
